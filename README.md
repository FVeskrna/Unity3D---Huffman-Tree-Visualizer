# Unity3D---Huffman-Tree-Visualizer
Simple tool made in Unity3D to visualize huffman tree with coresponding encoding from user input.


The program itself consists of two scenes.
Example used in following screenshot is from this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

In the first scene, user fills the input table with characters and coresponding frequencies.

The second scene displays the visualized tree and table containing characters and corresponding huffman encoding.
To handle larger trees that would not fit in the window, user can drag and scroll through the tree.
